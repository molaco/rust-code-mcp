I'll create comprehensive documentation based on the synthesized research. Let me structure this as a complete guide for the rust-code-mcp project.I've created comprehensive strategic documentation for the rust-code-mcp project. Here's what the document includes:

## Document Overview

**File:** `/home/molaco/Documents/rust-code-mcp/STRATEGIC_ANALYSIS.md` (39,000+ words)

### Key Sections:

1. **Executive Summary** - Quick overview of status, strengths, gaps, and timeline
2. **Introduction** - Purpose, scope, and target audience  
3. **Architecture & Competitive Positioning** - Deep comparison with cloud-native alternatives (claude-context)
4. **Tool Capabilities Analysis** - All 8 MCP tools with strategic implications
5. **Hybrid Search Implementation** - Technical details of BM25 + Vector RRF fusion
6. **Code Chunking Strategies** - Comparison and recommended hybrid approach
7. **Critical Issues** - 5 prioritized bugs blocking production (with code examples)
8. **Maturity Assessment** - Current status and unverified claims
9. **Implementation Roadmap** - 4-phase plan with detailed tasks, code samples, and success criteria
10. **Strategic Positioning** - Market positioning statement, differentiators, and target audiences
11. **Enhancement Strategy** - 3-tier embedding quality approach
12. **Actionable Recommendations** - Week-by-week priorities with owners and metrics

### Highlights:

- **Complete technical analysis** with code examples throughout
- **Clear prioritization** (CRITICAL → IMPORTANT → MEDIUM → LOW)
- **Realistic timelines** (3-4 weeks to production readiness)
- **Actionable roadmap** with specific implementation steps
- **Strategic positioning** as complementary (not competitive) to cloud solutions
- **Success metrics** for technical, UX, community, and strategic goals

The documentation positions rust-code-mcp as the **only local-first, privacy-focused code intelligence tool with TRUE hybrid search**, serving privacy-conscious developers, regulated industries, and cost-sensitive teams that cloud-native alternatives cannot adequately serve.
